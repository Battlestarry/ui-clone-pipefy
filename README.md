# Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

This project is a demonstration of how to add Okta as an identity
provider for an existing application. 

Rather than concoct an example, I wanted to use an
existing sample application that more accurately represents what a
real-world application would look like. To that end, the sample
application that I selected is the [MVC Music Store](https://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/), which you're
probably familiar with if you're a .NET developer.

The MVC Music Store is a sample application that is also an
introduction to the [open source](https://www.asp.net/open-source) [ASP.NET web application framework](https://www.asp.net/). 

In this document, I will show you how to modify a completed
MVC Music Store application to use Okta for login, registration,
Single Sign-on, as well as user and group management.

I suggest following this document from beginning to end, as each
section builds upon the last. 

# Setup and Configuration<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

Before you get started, you'll need to install or set up the
software and services below:

1.  Download and install [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx).
    
    At the time that I write this (November 2014), this is the most
    recent version of Visual Studio available.
2.  Sign up for [Okta Developer Edition](http://developer.okta.com/).
    
    You'll need an Okta "organization" of your own to use as you follow
    this gude.
3.  *Optional:* Sign up for a [30 day free trial of Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/register).
    
    This isn't strictly required. If you want to see how Okta enables you
    to seamlessly integrate 3rd party applications, then I
    suggest signing up for Zendesk, which is the application I use to
    demonstrate seamless single sign-on in this guide.
4.  *Optional:* Sign up for a [free trial of Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/).
    
    This isn't required either. This guide assumes that you'll be
    following along using Visual Studio on your personal
    computer. However, if you want to host your code somewhere
    public-facing, then Azure is the easiest place to do that.

# MVC 4 Music Store<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

This project builds upon the excellent MVC Music Store
application. *However* this in this example I use "Visual Studio
Express 2013 for Web" and ASP.NET MVC 4, *not* "Visual Web Developer 2010
Express SP1" and ASP.NET MVC 3 as is used in the MVC Music Store
example. At the time that I write this (November 2014), Visual
Studio Express 2013 for Web is the most recent freely available
version of Visual Studio Express.

Although they were written for MVC 3, the MVC Music Store
instructions still work with MVC 4, with a few key differences:

-   **Your project must be created with the ASP.NET MVC 4 "Internet"
    project template**. Not the "Empty" project template as the MVC
    Music Store instructions suggest for MVC 3.
-   MVC 4 no longer has the built-in "ASP.NET Configuration
    website", so you'll need to create the users and groups mentioned
    in "Part 7: Membership and Authorization" using a different
    technique.
-   You will need to add a <code>[InitializeSimpleMembership]</code> attribute
    after the <code>[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]</code> attribute
    mentioned in "Part 7: Membership and Authorization".

I cover these differences in more detail in the section below.

## Building the MVC Music Store<a id="sec-3-1" name="sec-3-1"></a>

Here is how to get set up on your own computer with Visual Studio
Express 2013 for Web and a working version of the MVC Music Store
for MVC 4:

1.  Download and install [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx).
2.  Except for the changes listed below, follow the [MVC 3 Music Store](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1)
          instructions.
3.  If you don't want to spend the time to go through the MVC 3 Music
    Store instructions, a completed version of the project is
    included with this project.

## Things to do differently when building the MVC Music Store for ASP.NET MVC 4<a id="sec-3-2" name="sec-3-2"></a>

Here are the things that you'll need to do differently when
building the MVC Music Store for MVC 4. The changes you'll need to
make are grouped according to the part of the MVC Music Store
instructions where you'll need to make the changes.

### Changes needed in [Part 1: Overview and File→New Project](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1)<a id="sec-3-2-1" name="sec-3-2-1"></a>

This is the very first part of the MVC Music Store instructions, they
cover what you'll be doing and how to get started. You'll need to
make the following changes in this part of the instructions:

1.  In the section named "Installing the software":

    -   You will be downloading [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx) instead of the tools listed in this section.

2.  In the section named "Creating a new ASP.NET MVC 3 project":

    -   You will be creating an "ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application" project. I use the name
        "Mvc4MusicStore" in this document, but you can name your project
        whatever you want.
    -   **Very important: You must select "Internet Application" as the project
        template** for your application. 
        <br />
        You'll run into issues in Part 7 if you don't!
        <br />
        
        ![img](./Documentation/Images/new-mvc4-project.png "Creating a new ASP.NET MVC 4 Project with the "Internet Application" template selected")

### Changes needed in [Part 7: Membership and Authorization](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-7)<a id="sec-3-2-2" name="sec-3-2-2"></a>

This part of MVC Music Store instructions cover adding users and groups
to the Music Store. This is the part of the instructions that change the
most with MVC 4. You will run into a lot of issues here if you did
not select "Internet" as the project template for your
application!

The major difference here is that you'll need to create your user
and "Administrator" group using different methods than are described in the MVC 3
Music Store instructions. The details for creating your user and
"Administrator" group are below:

1.  In the section named "Adding an Administrative User with the ASP.NET Configuration site":

    Instead of creating a user with the ASP.NET Configuration
    website, you'll be creating a user directly from the Music Store
    application.
    
    **Creating the "admin@example.com" user:**
    
    -   Run the code for your project and navigate to
        <code>/Account/Register</code>
    -   Create a user using the webpage at
        <code>/Account/Register</code>. I suggest using the
        same values suggested by the instructions, username: "admin@example.com",
        password: "password123!"
    
    **Manually adding the "Administrator" group:**
    
    -   From the "View" menu, select "Server Explorer"
    -   Expand the "Default Connections" section
    -   Expand "DefaultConnection"
    -   Expand "Tables"
    -   Right Click on "UserProfile", select "Show Table Data"
    -   In the "dbo.UserProfile [Data]" window that opens up, make sure that the "UserId" is "1"
        for the "UserName" of "admin@example.com"
         <br />
        ![img](./Documentation/Images/UserProfile-Data.png)
    -   In the "Server Explorer", right-click on "webpages\_Roles" and 
        select "Show Table Data"
    -   In the "dbo.webpages\_Roles [Data]" window that opens, up for
        Click on box that contains "*NULL*" in the "RoleName" column,
        type "Administrator" into that box.
         <br />
        ![img](./Documentation/Images/webpages_Roles-Data.png)
    -   In the "Server Explorer", right-click on
        "webpages\_UsersInRoles", and select select "Show Table Data"
    -   In the "dbo.webpages\_UsersInRoles [Data]" window that opens up,
        enter "1" into both the UserId and RoleId columns.
        <br />
        ![img](./Documentation/Images/webpages_UsersInRoles-Data.png)

2.  In the section named "Role-based Authorization":

    You'll only need to make two small changes in this section. In
    the *StoreManagerController.cs* file:
    
    -   Add <code>using Mvc4MusicStore.Filters;</code> to the top of
        the file.
    -   Add <code>[InitializeSimpleMembership]</code> under the
        <code>[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]</code> line.
        <br />
        ![img](./Documentation/Images/StoreManagerController-updated.png)

# Setting up Okta<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

At this point, you should have your very own Music Store written in
MVC 4. 

In the sections that follow, I will show you how to use Okta as the
identity store for the users and groups in the Music Store, how you
can read extended Okta user properties from the Music Store, how you
can manage your users and groups from inside of the Music Store, and
how to add Single sign-on functionality to your Music Store using
Okta.

Before we get started, you'll need to do a few things in the Okta
organization that you created previously (if you haven't signed up
for the [Okta Developer Edition](http://developer.okta.com/) yet, you need to do that now).

Here's what you'll need to do:

1.  Log in as the administrator user for your Okta account and
    access your [Okta Administrator Dashboard](https://support.okta.com/entries/27416107-What-Can-I-Do-as-an-Administrator-).
2.  [Create a new Okta group](https://support.okta.com/entries/27340138-Using-the-Okta-People-Page#Groups) called "Administrator".
3.  Add your administrator user to the "Administrator" group.
4.  [Get an Okta API token](http://developer.okta.com/docs/getting_started/getting_a_token.html) for your Okta organization. Copy this
    token somewhere as you'll be using it soon.

# Using Okta to authenticate your Music Store users<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

Now that you've finished setting up your Okta organization, we're
ready to start integrating Okta into your Music Store.

We'll be starting off by adding Okta as a "drop-in" replacement for user
authentication and authorization management. This is done by
implementing the Membership and Role providers in ASP.NET.

By integrating Okta via the ASP.NET Membership and Role providers,
a lot of template code in our application will "just work", for
example: user registration, user authorization, and changing passwords.

Adding the Okta Membership and Role providers will lay the
foundation that we'll build on in the rest of this guide.

**These are the steps you'll need to take to add Okta to your Music Store:**

1.  Install the Okta Providers project into your solution.
    -   Download the code to the [Okta Music Store](https://github.com/okta/okta-music-store).
    -   Copy the entire "OktaProviders" sub-folder from
        Mvc4MusicStore folder the Okta Music Store code to
        the base folder of your Mvc4MusicStore project.
    -   In the Solution Explorer window, right-click on the
        line that says "Solution 'Mvc4MusicStore'".
    -   Select "Add", then "Existing Project&#x2026;", select the
        OktaProviders folder your just copied, then select the
        "OktaProviders.csproj" file in that folder.
2.  Add a reference to the OktaProviders project.
    -   In Solution Explorer window, expand the "Mvc4MusicStore"
        project, and right-click on "References".
    -   Select "Add Reference&#x2026;"
    -   Click on "Solution" on the left side of the window.
    -   Click on the checkbox next to "OktaProviders".
    -   Click the "OK" button.
3.  Add the Okta SDK to the Mvc4MusicStore project from NuGet.
    -   Right click on the Mvc4MusicStore in your Solution Explorer
        window and select "Manage NuGet Packages&#x2026;"
    -   Click on "Online" on the left side of the window.
    -   Include Prerelease packages by changing the drop-down menu
        that says "Stable Only" to "Include Prerelease".
    -   Use the search box on the right of the window to search for
        "Okta".
    -   When you see the "Okta SDK" package, click on the "Install"
        button for that package.
    -   When the Okta SDK installation completes, click the "Close"
        button on the "Manage NuGet Packages" window.
4.  Add the Okta SDK to the OktaProviders project from NuGet.
    -   Follow the same steps above, but for the "OktaProviders" project.
5.  Edit the "Web.config" file in the Mvc4MusicStore project.
    Add the XML below inside of the
    <code>&lt;appSettings&gt;</code> tag.<br/>
    Make sure that you set the "okta:ApiToken" to the API token
    that you generated in "Setting up Okta" section and that you
    replace the "okta:ApiUrl" with the URL to your Okta
    organization.
    
    ```xml
    <add key="okta:ApiToken" value="01Abcd2efGHIjKl3m4NoPQrstu5vwxYZ_AbcdefGHi" />
    <add key="okta:ApiUrl" value="https://example.okta.com" />
    ```
    
    **Remember to use real values for the okta:ApiToken and the
    okta:ApiUrl!**
    
    Add the following inside of the <code>&lt;system.web&gt;</code> tag:<br/>
    
    ```xml
    <membership defaultProvider="SimpleMembershipProvider">
      <providers>
        <add name="SimpleMembershipProvider" type="OktaProviders.OktaMembershipProvider, OktaProviders" />
      </providers>
    </membership>
    <roleManager enabled="true" defaultProvider="SimpleRoleProvider">
      <providers>
        <add name="SimpleRoleProvider" type="OktaProviders.OktaRoleProvider, OktaProviders" />
      </providers>
    </roleManager>
    ```

**Try it out: Log in to the Music Store using Okta**


1.  Start the Music Store from Visual Studio using the "Play" button
    or by selecting the "DEBUG" menu and selecting "Start Debugging".
2.  Add "/Account/Create" to the end of the "localhost" URL in
    Internet Explorer. You should see a "Register" page similar to
    the one depicted below.
3.  Create a new user, for example: "alice@example.com". Note that
    Okta has different password requirements than the Music Store
    defaults. Your password will require at least one upper-case
    letter. I suggest using: "Password123!".
    <br/>
    ![img](./Documentation/Images/Account-Register-alice.png)
4.  If everything works, you will see the normal Music Store
    homepage.

**If you get an error**

If you *don't* see the normal Music Store homepage, but instead see
a something like the image below, it probably means that you
forgot to configure the "okta:ApiToken" or "okta:ApiUrl" settings
in your "Web.config" file.

![img](./Documentation/Images/SimpleMembershipProvider-Configuration-Error.png)

**Seeing what the code is doing**

If you want to see how things are working in the code. 
Set a breakpoint on the
<code>var createdUser = okta.users.Add(userProfile);</code> line in
the "OktaMembershipProvider.cs" file located in the OktaProviders
project. (You can set a breakpoint in Visual Studio by clicking in
the left margin of the line where you want to set the
breakpoint, in the area where you see the red dot in the image
below)

![img](./Documentation/Images/OktaMembershipProvider-CreateUserAndAccount-breakpoint.png)

Once you've set that breakpoint, follow the steps in the "Log in to
the Music Store with Okta" section above. This time, when you click
the "Register" button, you'll be taken into Visual Studio once your
breakpoint is reached. Once you get to the breakpoint, step through
the code by pressing the "Step Into" button
![img](./Documentation/Images/Step-Into-Button.png) in the Visual Studio toolbar.

# Accessing Okta user profile data from the Music Store<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a>

In the previous section, we integrated Okta into the Music Store and
tested the integration by logging in to the Music Store with an Okta
account. 

In this section I will show you how to make use of the
additional user attributes that Okta stores for every user.

The [default Okta user profile object](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/rest/users.html#profile-object) stores the following
attributes: "login", "email", "firstName", "lastName", and
"mobilePhone". Thanks to the features of the Okta
[Universal Directory](https://www.okta.com/product/universal-directory.html), you can also extend the user profile for the
users in your Okta organization to support your own
organziation-specific custom attributes.

At a high level, here is what we'll need to do to enable the Music
Store to make use of the "firstName", "lastName", and "mobilePhone"
user attributes that Okta stores by default:

-   Extend the [MembershipUser](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.membershipuser%28v=vs.100%29.aspx) class to store those additional
    attributes.
-   Write our own implementation of the [IIdentity](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.principal.iidentity%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) interface that is
    also aware of the additional attributes.
-   Make our implementation of the IIdentity interface available to
    the to the rest of our code in "[HttpContext.Current.User](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcontext.user%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)"
    by handling the "AuthenticateRequest" event in the [ASP.NET Application Life Cycle](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178473%28v=vs.80%29.aspx). This is done by writing our own
    "[Application\_AuthenticateRequest](http://smehrozalam.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/using-customprincipal-with-forms-authentication-in-aspnet/)" method.
-   Fix an issue with the template code in the Account controller that
    conflicts with the Okta membership provider.
-   Update the "Account/Manage.cshtml" view to display these
    additional attributes.
-   Require users to enter in their first name, last name, and phone
    number when they register for the Music Store.

You will not need to write the MembershipUser class or the implementation of the
IIdentity interface because they are already part of the
OktaProviders project we added to the Music Store in the previous
section. The extended MembershipProvider class is called
"OktaMembershipUser" and the implementation of the IIdentity
interface is called "OktaIdentity".

With that code out of your way, here is how to give your Music Store
code access to the extra Okta user profile attributes:

**Handling the AuthenticateRequest event**

In order to give the rest of the Music Store code access to the
additional Okta use profile attributes, we need to change the type
of the user object that MVC uses to represent users.

To do this, we will write a handler for the AuthenticateRequest
event that will create a new OktaIdentity object and store it in
"HttpContext.Current.User".

We make this change by updating the the "Global.asax.cs" file as
follows:

Add <code>using OktaProviders;</code> and <code>using
System.Web.Security;</code> to the top of the file with the other
"using" statements.

Add this method to the "MvcApplication" class in the file:

```csharp
protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        string loggedUser = HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name;
        var memberUser = (OktaMembershipUser)Membership.GetUser(loggedUser);
        var roles = Roles.GetRolesForUser(loggedUser);
        var identity = new OktaIdentity(memberUser.UserName, true)
        {
            FirstName = memberUser.FirstName,
            LastName = memberUser.LastName,
            PhoneNumber = memberUser.PhoneNumber,
            Apps = memberUser.apps,
        };
        var principal = new System.Security.Principal.GenericPrincipal(identity, roles);
        HttpContext.Current.User = principal;
    }
}
```

Here is what these changes should look like in Visual Studio:

![img](./Documentation/Images/Global-asax-cs-AuthenticateRequest.png)

**Updating the Account controller**

The first change that needs to be made is the the Account controller
("AccountController.cs"). We need to add <code>using
OktaProviders;</code> to the top of the file with the other
"using" statements.

Next, we need to remove all references to the
"OAuthWebSecurity.HasLocalAccount" method from the Account
controller. (This is because Okta uses strings to uniquely identify
users and the "[WebSecurity.GetUserId](https://github.com/ASP-NET-MVC/aspnetwebstack/blob/256968e02c713ab04b3c34c1edca957625c29c5f/src/WebMatrix.WebData/WebSecurity.cs#L364)" method presumes that all
MembershipUser objects are identified by integers).

Here are the changes you'll need to make:

1.  In the <code>public ActionResult Disassociate(string provider, string providerUserId)</code> method:<br />
    Change:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    bool hasLocalAccount = OAuthWebSecurity.HasLocalAccount(WebSecurity.GetUserId(User.Identity.Name));
    ```
    
    to:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    bool hasLocalAccount = true;
    ```
2.  In the <code>public ActionResult Manage(ManageMessageId? message)</code> method:<br/>
    Change:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    ViewBag.HasLocalPassword = OAuthWebSecurity.HasLocalAccount(WebSecurity.GetUserId(User.Identity.Name));
    ```
    
    to:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    ViewBag.HasLocalPassword = true;
    ```
3.  In the <code>public ActionResult Manage(LocalPasswordModel model)</code> method:<br/>
    Change:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    bool hasLocalAccount = OAuthWebSecurity.HasLocalAccount(WebSecurity.GetUserId(User.Identity.Name));
    ```
    
    to:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    bool hasLocalAccount = true;
    ```
4.  In the <code>public ActionResult RemoveExternalLogins()</code> method:<br/>
    Change:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    ViewBag.ShowRemoveButton = externalLogins.Count > 1 || OAuthWebSecurity.HasLocalAccount(WebSecurity.GetUserId(User.Identity.Name));
    ```
    
    to:<br/>
    
    ```csharp
    ViewBag.ShowRemoveButton = externalLogins.Count > 1;
    ```

**Updating the Account/Manage view**

Now that we added the handler for the AuthenticateRequest event and
made the changes to the Account controller template code, we can
update the Manage view for the Account controoler to show the extra
attributes from the Okta user profile.

To this, you just need to update the "Views/Account/Manage.cshtml"
file as follows:

Directly underneath this line:

```xml
<p>You're logged in as <strong>@User.Identity.Name</strong>.</p>
```

Add these lines:

```xml
<p>First Name: <strong>@(((OktaProviders.OktaIdentity)User.Identity).FirstName)</strong></p>
<p>Last Name: <strong>@(((OktaProviders.OktaIdentity)User.Identity).LastName)</strong></p>
<p>Phone Number: <strong>@(((OktaProviders.OktaIdentity)User.Identity).PhoneNumber)</strong></p>
```

Here is what it should look like in Visual Studio:
![img](./Documentation/Images/Manage-cshtml.png)

**Try it out: See the extra Okta user profile data in the Music Store**

1.  Start the Music Store from Visual Studio using the "Play" button
    or by selecting the "DEBUG" menu and selecting "Start Debugging".
2.  Add "/Account/Login" to the end of the "localhost" URL in
    Internet Explorer. You should see a "Login" page similar to
    the one depicted below.
    ![img](./Documentation/Images/Log-in-Form.png)
3.  Log in using the user you orignally used to sign in to configure
    your Okta organization.
4.  Once you are logged in, add "/Account/Manage" to the end of the
    "localhost" URL in Internet Explorer.
5.  If everything works, you will see a page that looks like the one
    below.
    ![img](./Documentation/Images/Manage-Account-with-attributes.png)

**Adding extra user profile attributes to the Registration view**

Now that you've verified that you can see access Okta user
profile attributes from the Music Store, the last step in this
section is to update the Registration page to accept some of those
extra user profile attributes. To do this, we'll need to update the
RegisterModel for accounts and update the Register view for the
Account controller.

To update the RegisterModel for accounts, open the
"Models/AccountModel.cs" file and add the following to the
"RegisterModel" class:

```xml
[Required]
[Display(Name = "First Name")]
public string FirstName { get; set; }

[Required]
[Display(Name = "Last Name")]
public string LastName { get; set; }

[Required]
[Display(Name = "Phone Number")]
public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }

```

It should look like this:

![img](./Documentation/Images/RegisterModel-updated.png)

Lastly, to update the Register view, open the
"Views/Account/Register.cshtml" file and add the following just
after the closing "<li>" tag for the UserName:
\`\`\`xml
<li>
    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.FirstName)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.FirstName)
</li>
<li>
    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.LastName)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.LastName)
</li>
<li>
    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.PhoneNumber)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.PhoneNumber)
</li>
\`\`\`

It should look like this:

**Try it out: Register for a user with extra user profile data**

1.  Start the Music Store from Visual Studio using the "Play" button
    or by selecting the "DEBUG" menu and selecting "Start Debugging".
2.  Add "/Account/Register" to the end of the "localhost" URL in
    Internet Explorer. You should see a "Registration" page similar to
    the one depicted below.

# Managing your users and groups from inside the Music Store<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a>

While it is always possible to do user and group management
from the administrator interface of your Okta organization, most of
the time you will want to do those tasks directly from your
application. 

In this section you will learn how to manage users and groups via
the Music Store.

For this section, imagine that you are working on "[whitelabeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product)"
the Music Store and that you'll want to be able to change the way
that the Music Store looks depending on the user. An easy way to do
this would be to add users to groups and change the look and feel of
the Music Store based on what group the user is part of.

To manage which user is part of which group, you'll need to add
basic group management functionality to the Music Store. Thanks to
the design of the Membership and Role providers, this will be pretty
easy to do. The Membership and Role providers that you got
working in the previous section  already have support for managing users and groups (which
are called "Roles" in ASP.NET), all that we need to do is add some
UI on top of these providers.

Following the same techniques and principles that are taught in the
MVC Music Store instructions, I wrote some basic User and Group management
code for the [Okta Music Store](https://github.com/okta/okta-music-store). Since I expect that you've already learned
how to build this sort of UI, let's just copy over the code so you
can see how it works.

**Copying over the files**

In the Windows File Explorer, open folder for the Okta Music Store, navigate to
the "Controllers" folder and copy the following two files into the
"Controllers" folder for your project:

1.  "UserManagerController.cs"
2.  "GroupManagerController.cs"

Next, navigate to the "Models" folder and copy the following two
files into the "Models" folder for your project:

1.  "StoreUser.cs"
2.  "UserGroup.cs"

Lastly, navigate to the "Views" folder and copy the following two
folders into the "Views" folder for your project:

1.  "GroupManager"
2.  "UserManager"

**Try it out: Open the User Manager from the Music Store**

1.  Start the Music Store from Visual Studio using the "Play" button
    or by selecting the "DEBUG" menu and selecting "Start Debugging".
2.  Add "/UserManager" to the end of the "localhost" URL in
    Internet Explorer. You should see a "Log in" page.
3.  Log in as the administrator user for your Okta account
4.  You should see a page that looks like this:
    
    ![img](./Documentation/Images/Manage-Users.png)

If you have trouble logging in to the UserManager page, check in
your Okta organization and make sure that the user you are logging
in with is part of the "Administrator" group.

**How it works**

Adding custom user and group management to the Music Store was
fairly easy to do thanks to scaffolding in MVC and code that was
already written in the Membership and Role providers.

Most of the code is pretty simple. For example, here is the code
from the Index method in the UserManager controller:

```csharp
// GET: /UserManager/
public ActionResult Index()
{
    var membershipUsers = Membership.GetAllUsers();
    var userList = from MembershipUser user in membershipUsers select user.Email.ToString();
    return View(userList);
}
```

As you can see, this code is pretty simple. The first line of the
method users the [GetAllUsers()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dy8swhya%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) method of the Membership provider to
get all of the users. The next line uses a basic [LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397897.aspx) query to
select the user's email address from the results of the
GetAllUsers() method. The last line returns the list of email
addresses to the Index view.

Here is the code for the Index view:

```html
@model IEnumerable<string>
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Manage Users";
}
<h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>User Name</th><th></th></tr>
    @foreach (var userName in Model)
    {
        <tr>
            <td>@userName</td>
            <td>
                @Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { userName=userName })
                |
                @Html.ActionLink("Delete", "Delete", new { userName=userName })
            </td>
        </tr>
    }
</table>
```

This view is also pretty simple. It just takes series of usernames
as strings, iterates over the usernames and creates a table with one
username per row, adding "Edit" and "Delete" links for each
username.

Note: If you decide to read through the code in more detail, you
will notice that the groups that this code uses are all prepended
with the text "brand:" - this is done to distinguish the groups that
are used by the Music Store from other groups in the Okta organization.

# Set up contextual navigation links to the Music Store<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a>

At this point in the guide, we've added a lot of new features to the
Music Store but none of those features are available through the
site navigation. 

This is an easy thing to fix, we just need to change two files in
the "/Views/Shared" folder: "\_Layout.cshtml" and
"\_LoginPartial.cshtml":

\*Changes needed in "\_LoginPartial.cshtml"\*

Replace the entire contents of the file with the code below:

```html
@if (Request.IsAuthenticated) {
    <li>
        @Html.ActionLink(User.Identity.Name, "Manage", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "username", title = "Manage" })
    </li>
    if (Roles.IsUserInRole("StoreManager"))
    {
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Manage Store", "Index", "StoreManager")</li>
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Manage Users", "Index", "UserManager")</li>
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Manage Groups", "Index", "GroupManager")</li>
    }
    foreach (OktaProviders.OktaAppLink app in ((OktaProviders.OktaIdentity)User.Identity).Apps)
    {
        <li><a href="@(app.linkUrl)">@(app.label)</a></li>
    }
    <li>
    @using (Html.BeginForm("LogOff", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { id = "logoutForm" }))
    {
        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
        <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('logoutForm').submit()">Log off</a>
    }
    </li>
}
else
{
    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Register", "Register", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "registerLink" })</li>
    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Log in", "Login", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })</li>
}
```

\*Changes needed in "\_Layout.cshtml"\*

Replace this text:

```html
<li>
    <a href="@Url.Content("~/StoreManager/")">
        Admin
    </a>
</li>
```

With this this line:

```html
@Html.Partial("_LoginPartial");
```

**Try it out: Open the User Manager from the Music Store**

1.  Start the Music Store from Visual Studio using the "Play" button
    or by selecting the "DEBUG" menu and selecting "Start Debugging".
2.  You should see the familiar home page, but with new navigation
    links, like below:
    
    ![img](./Documentation/Images/Home-updated-navlinks.png)

You'll notice that the link to the store manager is no longer
visible. That is because the updated code will only show that link
of the user is in the "Administrator" group.

# *Optional:* Adding Single-sign on to your Music Store<a id="sec-9" name="sec-9"></a>

At this point your Music Store will have all of the basics of user
authentication and authorization working: Users can register, log in
and log out, and change their passwords. Administrators get access
to special sections of the website, can assign group membership and
administration rights to other users.

There are still quite a few features in the Okta API that we haven't
covered, external directory integration, using [CORS](http://developer.okta.com/docs/getting_started/enabling_cors.html), and the 
[Events API](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/rest/events.html) are a few examples. 

What I do want to cover is how to do Single sign-on from the Music
Store. 

In this section, I will show you how to seamlessly integrate Zendesk
into your application, this integration will allow Music Store users that are
logged in to the Music Store to click on a "Support" link and be
automatically logged in to a Zendesk application. Even though
Zendesk is a completely seperate application, the Music Store users
might not even notice. They will not need to enter a user name or
password to log in to Zendesk, they will not even need to register a
new account.

Here is a high level overview of the steps required to enable your
Music Store users to use Single sign-on to connect to Zendesk:

-   Add Zendesk to your Okta organization
-   Update the Music Store to support Okta Single sign-on

**Adding Zendesk to your Okta organization**

Before you get started, you'll need a Zendesk, if you
don't have one already, sign up for a [30 day free trial of
Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/register).

Once you've done that you'll need to configure your Okta
organization to connect to your Zendesk. 

To configure Okta and Zendesk, you can either follow these
[instructions from Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663696-Setting-up-SAML-single-sign-on-with-Okta-Plus-and-Enterprise-) or this [video from Okta](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUkYkKJeR1k)

Make sure you do the following when you set up Zendesk:

From Okta:

-   Configure Zendesk to use the "SAML 2.0" sign on method
-   Enable provisioning features for Zendesk
-   Enable the "Create Users" provisioning feature
-   Assign Zendesk to the "Everyone" group

From Zendesk:

-   Enable SAML SSO for End-users. This option is found in the "End
    User" tab on the "Security" page for Zendesk.

**Updating your Music Store to support Okta Single sign-on**

Once you've configured your Okta organization to single sign-on to
Zendesk, all that you have left to do is update the Music Store for
single sign-on.

To enable single sign-on, we need to update the Music Store to not
only authenticate the users with the Music Store, but with our 
Okta organization as well. In other words, instead of giving the
Music Store an authentication cookies for just the Music Store
domain, we need to have them get authentication cookies from Okta as
well. 

To do this, we will make use of a "cookieToken" that we get from
Okta when we use the Okta API to authenticate users. After
successfully authenticting a Music Store user, we will redirect the
user to Okta with their cookieToken to get them authenticated with
Okta as well.

Why do we need to do this? It's so that Okta can handle the single
sign-on flow on our behalf, which is much preferrable to writing our
own SAML implementation.

Here is what you need to do to enable single sign-on in your Music
Store:

In the "Login" method of the AccountController, replace this line:

```csharp
return RedirectToLocal(returnUrl);
```

With this code:

```csharp
if (HttpContext.Items.Contains(model.UserName))
{
    // If we have a cookieToken, redirect the user to Okta so that they get a cookie from Okta too.
    var cookieToken = HttpContext.Items[model.UserName] as String;
    var oktaApiUrl = new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["okta:ApiUrl"]);
    var redirectUrl = this.Url.Action("Index", "Home", null, this.Request.Url.Scheme);

    var cookieTokenUrl = String.Format("{0}login/sessionCookieRedirect?token={1}&redirectUrl={2}",
        oktaApiUrl.AbsoluteUri,
        cookieToken,
        redirectUrl);
    return Redirect(cookieTokenUrl);
}
else
{
    return RedirectToLocal(returnUrl);
}
```

Here is what it should look like:

![img](./Documentation/Images/Account-Controller_cookieToken.png)

**Try it out: Single Sign-on to Zendesk**

1.  Start the Music Store from Visual Studio using the "Play" button
    or by selecting the "DEBUG" menu and selecting "Start Debugging".
2.  When Internet Explorer opens, register for a new user by clicking
    on the "Register" link
3.  After being signed in to the Music Store as the new user, sign
    out, then log back in. Your browser should now have
    authentication cookies from both the Music Store and from your
    Okta organization.
4.  Click on the "Zendesk" link.
5.  You should be automatically logged in to Zendesk

In this document, you learned how to build the "MVC Music Store"
project in ASP.NET MVC 4, and how to use Okta as an identity provider in
an MVC 4 project.

In particular, this document demonstrated how to do the following:

-   Use Okta to store, manage, and authenticate users.
-   Store and display extended user profile attributes in Okta.
-   Federate an Okta powered website with another website that
    supports SAML and automatic account provisioning.

While this document does cover quite a bit of ground, it does not
cover all the features of the Okta Developer API. A few examples of
features that this document does not cover are:

-   External directory federation.
-   Enabling [CORS](http://developer.okta.com/docs/getting_started/enabling_cors.html).
-   The [Sessions](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/rest/sessions.html) API and [Events](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/rest/events.html) API.

**Learn more**

You can learn more about the Okta API by doing one or more of the
following:

-   Read the source code for the Membership and Role providers in this
    project. The files for those providers are in the "OktaProviders"
    folder of this project.
-   Read the [developer documentation for the Okta API](http://developer.okta.com/docs/getting_started/design_principles.html).
